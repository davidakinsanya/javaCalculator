Hi user, welcome to the first candidate release of A* Calculator! 

When you open the calculator, you'll be able to see a very simple UI 
with a text field, a set radio buttons and a calculate button.

The text field is met for you to type the expression you wan to calculate.
The radio buttons, for Standard and Reverse Polish Notation is meant for
you to enter the notation you want to calculate.

Standard: 1+1, 8+2, 2*3
Reverse Polish 11+, 82+, 23* 

When you press 'Calculate', the program parses the expression depending on 
notation and returns the solution wuthin the text field. You MUST select a 
notation or the program will complain via the text field.

For standard notation expressions, you can write basic arithmetic without 
indenting with whitespaces (like 1+1, 60+10 and 7*8/9) but arthmetic 
involving brackets must be indented.

eg (1) + (2) + (3) or (2*2) + (7*2) + (14)

For ALL expressions in reverse polish, you MUST indent with whitespace 
between every character wheter its a digit or not.

Please be aware that the calculator program is not pefect and some 
arthmetic expressions will result in error through no fault of 
your own.

Thanks for reading,
David.
